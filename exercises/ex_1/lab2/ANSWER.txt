		Q: WHY DOES THE PROPERTY FAIL at 30?
    A: Because the consequent (req ##2 gnt) is not asserted.
    Both req and gnt is deasserted.

		Q: WHY DOES THE PROPERTY PASS at 90?
    A: At time 90 the property has been covered. It
    only cares if the property has previously
    happened.

		Q: WHY DOES THE PROPERTY PASS at 150?
    A: Same answer as the previous answer, but we
    notice that the signals are correct as oppose to
    previously.

		Q: WHY DOES THE PROPERTY FAIL at 170?
    A: It fails because gnt is not asserted at this
    time stamp even though req was asserted 2 CC earlier.

		Q: WHY DOES THE PROPERTY FAIL at 190?
    A: At time stamp 150 cstart and req is asserted
    which should imply the asserion of gnt at time stamp
    190.

		Q: WHY DOES THE PROPERTY FAIL at 70?
    A: It fails because cstart is asserted at time
    stamp 50 which implies that req should be
    asserted at time stamp 70.

		Q: WHY DOES THE PROPERTY PASS at 90?
    A: It passes because cstart is asserted at 30, req is
    asserted at 50 and gnt is asserted at 90. The property
    is then covered.

		Q: WHY DOES THE PROPERTY FAIL at 170?
    A: It failes because cstart is asserted at 110, req
    is asserted at 130 but gnt is not asserted at 170.

		Q: WHY DOES THE PROPERTY FAIL at 190?
    A: It failes because cstart is asserted at 130, req
    is asserted at 150 but gnt is not asserted at 190.

		Q: WHY DOES THE PROPERTY PASS at 210?
    A: It passes because cstart is asserted at 150, req
    is asserted at 170 and gnt is asserted at 210.
